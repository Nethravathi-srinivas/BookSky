**BookSky – Book Management Web App**

BookSky is a simple yet functional web application that allows users to manage a personal book collection. This CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application is built using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** – no frameworks or databases, making it ideal for beginners to understand DOM manipulation and UI logic.

**Features**

 **Create**: Add new books with a title, author, and short description using a popup form.
 **Read**: View all books in a card-style UI layout.
 **Delete**: Remove books from the collection with a click.
 **Simple UI**: Clean and modern design using custom CSS and Google Fonts.
 **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly layout with intuitive controls.
